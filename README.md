# Not Portal - Attempt at replicating portal in Unity

This is a demo of a Portal clone built in Unity for an CS independent study course.

This was a group project where Kiru worked on the portals, LoveTheBirds worked on the levels, and NickIsSwag worked on the movement.

This took 2 weeks to make so mind how rough and broken it looks. We don't plan on coming back to this project.
